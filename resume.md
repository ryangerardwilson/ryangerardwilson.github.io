# Resume - Ryan Gerard Wilson

## Summary

I deliver high-impact results as a cross-functional individual contributor in 
startups by rapidly iterating on both business logic and production code-shipping 
simplified statistical and AI/ML solutions that drive measurable efficiency gains 
(e.g., 20%+ supply improvements and first-time ML productionizations)-backed by 
10 years of diverse professional experience spanning intellectual property 
litigation, solo indie hacking (3x full-stack founder), and operational scaling 
in high-growth environments. 

Passionate about crafting ultra-efficient developer tools and power-user systems 
that eliminate friction and amplify personal productivity.

## Core Tech Stack

At its core, includes my self-engineered hyper-efficient, distraction-free 
development environment on Arch Linux powered by my custom terminal-based system 
-delivering snappy file navigation, Vim-centric editing, and seamless workflow 
automation via tailored bash scripts that minimize GUI dependence and maximize 
CLI productivity. I have shipped production-grade applications across Python, 
Rust, PHP, JavaScript, Laravel, Node.js, Next.js, React, Tailwind, Flask, 
FastAPI, and Flutter, - and consider myself language-agnostic but rooted in the 
idea of constantly deepening my grasp of assembly, K&R C, and Python.

## Entrepreneur-in-Residence, Wiom (October 2022 - Present)

At Wiom, I serve on the two-person Decision Sciences team—a focused offshoot of 
Product-where we consistently drive outsized business impact by sharpening vague 
problem statements, resisting premature coding urges, ruthlessly simplifying 
solutions, shipping to production fast, tracking real metrics, and decisively 
iterating or pivoting. Key contributions include:

a. Genie (2025): Boosted supply efficiency by 20% total (15% from core rewrite + 
5% from ML integration) by revamping Wiom's critical lead-matchmaking 
algorithm-delivering faster, more reliable lead servicing through simplified code 
and product logic that intelligently assesses serviceability and notifies optimal 
partners at the right time. Seamlessly rewrote and deployed a poorly documented 
legacy algorithm to production with zero downtime after the original creator's 
exit. Later, productionized Wiom's first real ML model by refactoring a chaotic 
Jupyter-based Graph Neural Network prototype into clean, maintainable Python 
classes; separated product and business logic for transparency and introduced a 
control API enabling non-technical teams to adjust rules in minutes without 
redeployments-establishing robust, business-friendly ML practices company-wide.

b. CRM Forge (2024): Slashed technical debt by over 90% and accelerated CRM 
deployments from weeks to under 60 minutes, unlocking rapid business 
experimentation. Built a lightweight internal platform (~7,000 lines of code) 
that instantly provisions fully customized CRM workflows via simple JSON 
configurations (2-3 minutes), consolidating and replacing five bloated legacy 
systems totaling ~100,000 lines—enabling tech and business teams to align and 
ship tailored solutions in hours instead of prolonged cycles.

c. Happy (2023): Reduced reliance on call center headcount by ~5x while 
elevating customer experience and agent effectiveness. Engineered an integrated 
system combining a telephony BOT with a minimal-staff CRM to efficiently manage 
high-pain escalations, and developed an AI chatbot (Hindi/Hinglish) that 
instantly surfaces brand-aligned scripts—cutting agent frustration, speeding 
resolutions, and ensuring consistent, high-quality handling of unhappy customers 
even under volume spikes.

Additional Roles: Leveraged deep legal expertise in technology, IP, and corporate 
law to shape Wiom's IP strategy, protect innovations, and support successful 
fundraising rounds—including pitch deck refinement and investor-facing legal 
diligence.

## Solo IndieHacker (June 2021 - September 22)

Single-handedly launched and marketed three full-stack Laravel products as a solo 
founder (SLTYE, Equity's Darlings, LavendOrb), handling everything from market 
research, backend/frontend development, landing page copywriting, branding/domain/
trademark checks, to attending 50+ networking events for direct sales-while 
bootstrapping under severe financial constraints (including a high-risk credit 
card loan). The startup grind meant being both 'builder' and 'seller' -  
transforming the experience into a real-life-MBA in resilience, sales, finance, 
and tech. 

## Intellectual Property & IP/Tech Lawyer (December 2015 - April 2022)

Accelerated to Senior Associate 3–5 years ahead of industry norms at boutique firm 
Sujata Chaudhri IP Attorneys (SCIP) by delivering standout results in high-profile 
litigation—including successfully prosecuting and securing an interim injunction in 
the landmark Rubik's Cube trade dress case that set precedent for toy IP protection 
in India—while leading firm-building initiatives such as full website migration to 
WordPress, establishing a sustainable attorney blogging system for thought 
leadership, and publishing interdisciplinary advocacy integrating neuroscience into 
trademark law arguments.

At Rahul Chaudhry & Partners (RCYP, 2019–2022), resolved hundreds of trademark 
disputes through pre-litigation mediations, saving clients significant time and 
legal costs by negotiating favourable out-of-court settlements in the majority of 
cases, drafting airtight agreements, leveraging precedents effectively, and 
seamlessly escalating to litigation when required-sharpening high-stakes negotiation, 
client management, and strategic decision-making skills directly transferable to 
startup deal-making and risk mitigation.

These experiences built deep insight into modern business dynamics, AI/ML 
technologies, and IP strategy, while honing transferable strengths in innovation, 
project leadership, and analytical rigor—validated by research showing 
language-trained professionals (like lawyers) often excel in programming aptitude 
(see 2020 Nature study: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60661-8).

## Marketing Associate, Rainmaker (April 2015 - November 2015)

Drove measurable marketing impact in my first professional role at an early-stage 
startup by boosting email open rates and engagement through personalized, A/B-tested 
campaigns in Mailchimp (crafted compelling subject lines, segmentation, and custom 
HTML-enhanced designs), curating authentic customer testimonials that built trust 
and lifted website conversion rates, and executing a high-energy on-campus quiz 
event for 300+ law students that amplified brand visibility and generated leads via 
strong event design, team coordination, and live audience management.

Gained early, invaluable exposure to the full startup lifecycle-including the harsh 
realities of cash burn and operational shutdown within six months-observing 
leadership navigate layoffs, delayed salaries, and crisis decisions firsthand. This 
built deep resilience to business uncertainty, crystallized an acknowledgment of the 
power of coding for 100x efficiency gains (sparking my self-taught programming 
journey and eventual career pivot), and laid the foundation for a builder mindset 
that thrives in high-risk, resource-constrained environments.

## Open Source

Built projects with 117+ GitHub repositories as a commitment to craftsmanship,
self-directed learning, and building power-user tools that solve real pain 
points in programming, data analysis, and productivity. Highlights include:

a. rtutor: Sharpened programming intuition and built resilience against 
AI-generated code slop by creating a terminal-based learning environment inspired 
by gtypist and Unix man pages—enabling structured access to personal notes, 
deliberate practice of touch typing, and refined taste across Assembly, Python, C, 
and SQL; serves as the spiritual successor to my earlier Rust data-science 
explorations. See: [rtutor](https://github.com/ryangerardwilson/rtutor).

b. vios: Achieved lightning-fast, distraction-free development workflows through 
a custom terminal-based “operating system” inspired by the classic Emacs 
experience—providing snappy file system navigation, Vim integration for editing, 
Zathura for PDFs, and seamless create/delete/rename/cut/paste operations; 
functions as my primary IDE for complex, multi-directory projects. 
See: [vios](https://github.com/ryangerardwilson/vios).

c. vixl: Replicating 80% of spreadsheet power inside the terminal with Vim-like 
motions (normal, insert, visual modes) for navigating and editing live Pandas 
DataFrames—delivering a lightweight, keyboard-driven alternative to traditional 
GUI tools like Excel for rapid data exploration and manipulation. 
See: [vixl](https://github.com/ryangerardwilson/vixl).

d. rgwml: Gained deep under-the-hood mastery of Python/Pandas data-science 
operations by re-implementing key functionality in Rust during early learning 
phases—resulting in a widely adopted library with over 300,000 downloads that 
strengthened systems-level intuition and laid the groundwork for raw, 
high-performance data analysis directly in the Python REPL.
