# Resume - Ryan Gerard Wilson

## Summary

10 years of professional experience, former 3x founder, and currently building 
a career as a cross-functional IC (individual contributor) in start ups, where 
I iterate over both, the business logic and the code/ technical implementation 
of simple statistical as well as AI/ML models, with early career experience in 
intellectual property litigation, and a hobbyist of building the 'ideal' dev 
'power-user' operating system.

## Core Tech Stack

Arch Linux with a personally-built terminal-based operating system. See: 
[vios](https://github.com/ryangerardwilson/vios). Customized bash scripts for 
CLI efficiency, Vim, and a focus on Assembly (for hardware intuition), C (for 
language-agnostic foundations), and Python (for practical, data-driven 
engineering). Proficient in production apps using Python, Rust, PHP, 
JavaScript, Laravel, Node.js, Next.js, React, Tailwind, Flask, and FastAPI. 

## Entrepreneur-in-Residence, Wiom (October 2022 - Present)

At Wiom, I work in the *Decision Sciences* team (a 2 person offshoot of the
Product Team). As part of this team, we take a problem statement, make it less 
dumb, restrain our action-bias to write code unless we are certain that the 
problem is articulated properly, ruthlessly simplify the most viable solution.  
Push to production. Track metrics. And, take a call whether to persevere with 
future iterations or pivot. Key Contributions include:

a. Genie (2025): Rebuilt Wiom's core matchmaking algorithm (simplifying both
the code, and the Product design). Genie determines if a new lead is
serviceable, and if so, decides which Partners should be notified of that lead,
and when. The employee who originally created the algo left at a time when
documentation practices we poor - thus, re-writing and deploying this algo to
production with zero downtime was massively painful, and rewarding. A few months 
post the initial deployment, integrated a prototype GNN (graph neural network) 
into Genie. Prototypes are easy, production is hard. While a GNN may be a simple 
set of python scripts of under 10000 lines of code, the data scientist who 
prototyped this typically work in jupyter notebooks with a procedural programming 
style, in a manner that does not always look readable and expressive. Had to 
strain my eyes for weeks to re-write that logic into pythonic objects with 
well-defined responsibilities interfacing with each other within the genie 
codebase. Also, business teams wanted simplicity and hated the idea of some 
voodoo-logic making decisions, so I had to deploy it in a manner that segregated 
'product oriented genie' from 'business oriented genie'. Also, gave product and 
business teams a 'control layer', that allowed them to change the product/
business logic of genie within minutes without needing a full re-deployment.

b. CRM Forge (2024): Built an internal 'Salesforce' - which allows tech teams
to deploy customized CRM-like workflows for business teams in less than 60
minutes. Reduced technical debt - less than 7000 lines of code were used to
deploy a total of 5 CRM systems.

c. Happy (2023): Built a system of apps to reduce reliance on human call centre
executives, via a telephony BOT, and a CRM which coordinates a minimal number
of employees to handle high-pain escalations.

Additional Roles: Apply legal expertise in technology, IP, and corporate law to
help out with IP strategy and fund-raise efforts.

## Solo IndieHacker (June 2021 - September 22)

The startup grind meant being both 'builder' and 'seller'. Creating pitch decks 
from scratch, attending over 50 events for networking and sales, grinding 
coding courses, stretching finances, maxing a credit card for a loan 10x the 
last drawn salary, and pivoting to job hunting when cash burn became dangerous - 
transforming the experience into a real-life-MBA in resilience, sales, finance, 
and tech. 

Built three applications in Laravel PHP, namely - a personal finance management 
web-app, called SLTYE (spend less than you earn); a CRM for small law firms, 
called Equity's Darlings; and a goal-motivation matrix based to do list app, 
called LavendOrb. Did market research, wrote the backend, frontend, copy of the 
landing page, signed up for numerous business networking events to implement 
sales and marketing strategies. 

## Intellectual Property & IP/Tech Lawyer (December 2015 - April 2022)

My early career in intellectual property (IP) and tech law-built at boutique 
firms Sujata Chaudhri IP Attorneys (SCIP) and Rahul Chaudhry & Partners (RCYP) 
in NCR, India—deepened my grasp of modern business dynamics, artificial 
intelligence, and machine learning technologies, honing transferable 
entrepreneurial skills in innovation, project management, negotiation, and 
thought leadership. Notably, a 2020 Nature study highlights that language 
aptitude, rather than mathematics, best predicts programming mastery, aligning 
with my analytical background for tech entrepreneurship. See study: 
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60661-8

Promoted to Senior Associate at SCIP in 2018, 3–5 years ahead of industry 
norms-I excelled in complex projects like high-profile injunctions, led 
initiatives such as website revamps and content systems, mentored teams, and 
pioneered interdisciplinary advocacy, accelerating personal growth in 
leadership and strategy that directly supported later indie hacking and 
startup ventures.

At RCYP (2019–2022), I negotiated hundreds of pre-litigation mediations 
between IP disputants, resolving most out of court to optimize efficiency and 
costs while drafting agreements, leveraging precedents, and pivoting to 
formal actions when needed, thereby building high-stakes negotiation 
expertise and client relationship management skills essential for 
entrepreneurial deal-making.

## Marketing Associate, Rainmaker (April 2015 - November 2015)

First job. Worked on email marketing campaigns using GUI tools, organized a
marketing quiz for law school kids, learned basic HTML to help me make pretty
emails. Realized I could be 100x more efficient if I dedicated my self fully to 
the art and science of programming. Start up burnt too much cash too fast in a
bad business cycle, and went operationally dead within 6 months. Got to observe 
first hand tough decisions start up leadership need to make when funding dries 
up (lay offs, motivating employess to work despite paying half salaries, etc.).

## Academic Background

- 2007: Goethe-Zertifikat B1, Goethe-Institut e.V. 
- 2015: B.A. LL.B. (Hons.), Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia National Law University, 
        Lucknow 

## Open Source 

With over 117 Github repos, I would highlight the following:

a. rtutor: Inspired by the classic gtypist tool (which I used to learn touch 
typing) and the classic unix 'man pages', built to access and organize my 
learnings, refine programming taste, improve my ability to identify AI slop in 
AI-generated code snippets, and practice touch typing across assembly, python, 
C lang, and SQL. See: [rtutor](https://github.com/ryangerardwilson/rtutor).

b. vios: Inspired from the classic 'emacs-os' computing experience, a
terminal-based interface that makes it easy (and snappy) to navigate through
the file system, create, delete, rename, cut, paste - files and directories,
besides opening files in vim, and pdfs in zathura. Serves as my IDE, when I
need to work on projects that involve a complex tree of dirs and sub-dirs. See:
[vios](https://github.com/ryangerardwilson/vios).

c. rgwml: Built at a time when I found Python's data model confusing and was
intrigued by Rust, I challenged myself to understand what happens 'under the
hood' in common data science/ machine learning operations in the Python/Pandas,
by re-writing whatever I found useful in Pandas - to Rust. This Rust library
got over 300,000 downloads. See: [RGWML](https://crates.io/search?q=rgwml).
Over time, as my programming intuition deepended, I stopped using the library
as a 'crutch', and pivoted to 'raw-dogging' data analysis in the Python REPL.
rtutor (point a. above) can be considered rgwml's 'spiritual-successor'.
