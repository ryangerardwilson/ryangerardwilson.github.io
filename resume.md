# Resume - Ryan Gerard Wilson

## Summary

With over 10 years of professional experience, I design, develop, and deploy
advanced AI and Machine Learning models into production environments. *See:
[Website](https://ryangerardwilson.com)*

- Residence: Gurgaon, India
- Email: ryangerardwilson@gmail.com
- Phone: +91-9958467951

My tech stack is based on Arch Linux (Omarchy), vanilla vim (no plugins, just
simple tweaks to a .vimrc), and XAI's SuperGrok (with the pre-configured
instruction "roast my code as if you were Linus Trovalds"). With experience in
PHP, JS, Python, across frameworks like Laravel, Flask, FASTAPI, NextJS, React
... I consider myself language-agnostic. That said, I deliberately invest time
to, focus on fundamentals in:

a. Assembly (to strengthen intuition on how hardware registers work, and to
appreciate C lang)

b. C lang (because I'm a BIG fan of Linus Trovalds; all high level languages
are implemented in C; this helps me appreciate all high level languages,
keeping me language-agnostic)

c. Python (because engineering is less about writing code, and more about
solving real world problems).

## Entrepreneur-in-Residence, Wiom (2022 - Present)

At Wiom, I work in the *Decision Sciences* team. As part of this team, we take
a problem statement, make it less dumb, restrain our action-bias to write code
unless we are certain that the problem is articulated properly, ruthlessly
simplify the most viable solution.  Push to production. Track metrics. And,
take a call whether to persevere with future iterations or pivot. Key
Contributions include:

a. Genie (2025): Rebuilt Wiom's core matchmaking algorithm (simplifying both
the code, and the Product design). Genie determines if a new lead is
serviceable, and if so, decides which Partners should be notified of that lead,
and when. The employee who originally created the algo left at a time when
documentation practices we poor - thus, re-writing and deploying this algo to
production with zero downtime was massively painful, and rewarding.

b. CRM Forge (2024): Built an internal 'Salesforce' - which allows tech teams
to deploy customized CRM-like workflows for business teams in less than 60
minutes. Reduced technical debt - less than 7000 lines of code were used to
deploy a total of 5 CRM systems.

c. Happy (2023): Built a system of apps to reduce reliance on human call centre
executives, via a telephony BOT, and a CRM which coordinates a minimal number
of employees to handle high-pain escalations.

Additional Roles: Apply legal expertise in technology, IP, and corporate law to
help out with IP strategy and fund-raise efforts.

## Portfolio of the Best Code I've Written in Public Repos (2025)

With over 117 Github repos, I would highlight the following:

a. rtutor, pytutor, ctutor, atutor: Built to solve this problem for myself:
given that AI vastly improves my ability to access 'low quality code', what
rituals must I practice to avoid AI slop in my projects in this era of 'vibe-
coding'.  These apps are systems to keep coding muscle memory sharp by
practicing writing small snippets of code as a daily ritual, in python, c lang,
and assembly, respectively. See:
[pytutor](https://github.com/ryangerardwilson/pytutor),
[ctutor](https://github.com/ryangerardwilson/ctutor), and
[atutor](https://github.com/ryangerardwilson/atutor).  By mid-October 2025, I
realized that I could combine all my tutor apps into a single, rtutor app, with
a gtypist-like interface, and feature a progression of tutor courses organized
as courses -> parts -> lessons. This way, I can scale the detail of the lessons
as per the competency of the user. See:
[rtutor](https://github.com/ryangerardwilson/rtutor).

b. vimtutor-advanced: Built this to solve this problem for myself: what rituals
must I practice to use my computer as a samurai does his sword.  This expands
the classic vimtutor cli, covering advanced vim concepts set out in Steve
Oualline's 2001 VimBook. The tutor also expands the idea of using a vim-based
muscle memory to window tiling and browser based navigation, to maximize
productivity by building muscle memory with the right conventions. At one
point, the tutor also covered NeoVim, however, I removed NeoVim tutorials after
concluding that the origianl vim is simply the superior product. See:

## IndieHacker (2021-22)

Once I gained confidence that I could 'move fast and break things', I quit law
firms to IndieHack my way to my own startup. Hustled SaaS and LegalTech
business ideas. They did not work out, and failed in quick succession within 6
months.

a. SLTYE: A personal finance app, that helps you 'Spend Less Than You Earn'.
Hence, the acronym S.L.T.Y.E.

b. LavendOrb: A dashboard app that helps break complex goals into short,
medium, and long term actionable steps using First Principles.

c. EquitysDarlings: A CRM for law firms.

## Intellectual Property & Tech Lawyer (2016-20)

After my intial foray into the start up world with Rainmaker, I pivoted to
pursue a career in intellecutal property and tech law, working with two
boutique law firms over 5 (Sujata Chaudhri IP Attorneys, and Rahul Chaudhry and
Partners, rising up to the rank of a Senior Associate. Maintained a deep
interest in ideas of Elon Musk, Naval Ravikant, and other doomsday prophets of
how AI is going to change everything - and a equally deep regret for
Rainmaker's brutal ending (see below) - which is why I decided to spend the
years working in law, to also learn to code -  and keep my dream of doing a
tech start up in the future alive.

## Marketing Associate, Rainmaker (2015)

First job. Worked on email marketing campaigns using GUI tools. Realized I
could be 100x more efficient if I knew how to code. Start up burnt too much
cash too fast, and went operationally dead within n 6 months. Got to observe
first hand tough decisions start up leadership need to make when funding dries
up (lay offs, paying employees half salaries, etc.).
