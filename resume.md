# Resume - Ryan Gerard Wilson

## Summary

I'm a hands-on individual contributor who ships fast in startups, bridging
business needs and production code. I build and iterate on lightweight
statistical and ML solutions that deliver real impact—like 20%+ gains in supply
efficiency or getting ML models into production for the first time.

Background spans 10 years: intellectual property litigation, three solo full-
stack founder stints (indie hacking from scratch), and scaling operations in
high-growth companies.

Passionate about crafting ultra-efficient developer tools and power-user
systems that eliminate friction and amplify personal productivity.

## Core Tech Stack

At its core, includes my self-engineered hyper-efficient, distraction-free
terminal-first-for-everything development environment on Arch Linux -delivering
snappy file navigation, Vim-centric editing, and seamless workflow automation
via tailored bash scripts that minimize GUI dependence and maximize CLI
productivity. I have shipped production-grade applications across Python, Rust,
PHP, JavaScript, Laravel, Node.js, Next.js, React, Tailwind, Flask, FastAPI,
and Flutter, - and consider myself language-agnostic but rooted in the idea of
constantly deepening my grasp of assembly, K&R C, and Python.

## Entrepreneur-in-Residence, Wiom (October 2022 - Present)

At Wiom, I'm on a two-person Decision Sciences team (out of Product) that
clarifies vague problems, resists premature coding, simplifies ruthlessly,
ships fast to production, track real metrics, and iterate or pivot decisively.
Key projects include:

a. Genie (2025): Boosted supply efficiency 20% (15% from rewrite + 5% from ML).
Revamped the core lead-matching engine for faster, more reliable
servicing—better logic, serviceability checks, and partner timing. Reverse-
engineered and redeployed an undocumented legacy algorithm with zero downtime
post-creator exit. Then productionized Wiom's first ML model: refactored a
messy Jupyter GNN prototype into clean Python classes, separated business
rules, and added a control API for non-tech teams to tweak in minutes—no
redeploys needed.

b. CRM Forge (2024): Slashed technical debt >90% and cut CRM deployments from
weeks to <1 hour, enabling rapid experimentation. Built a lean platform (~7k
LOC) that provisions custom workflows via JSON configs in 2–3 minutes,
replacing five legacy systems (~100k LOC total). Let teams align and ship
tailored solutions in hours.

c. Happy (2023): Cut call-center dependency ~5x while improving customer
outcomes and agent experience. Built a telephony bot + lightweight CRM for
escalations, plus a Hindi/Hinglish AI chatbot delivering brand-consistent
scripts instantly—faster resolutions, less agent frustration, consistent
quality during spikes.

Beyond core work: Used my tech/IP/corporate law background to define Wiom's IP
strategy, protect innovations, and support fundraising (pitch deck refinements,
investor legal diligence).

## Solo IndieHacker (June 2021 - September 22)

Built and launched three full-stack Laravel products (SLTYE, Equity's Darlings,
LavendOrb) from scratch while bootstrapping under tight constraints—including a
high-risk credit card loan. Handled the full cycle: market research, backend/
frontend dev, landing page copy, branding, domain/trademark checks, and direct
sales via 50+ networking events.

The grind forced me to wear both builder and seller hats-turning it into a
crash-course MBA in resilience, sales, finance, and shipping real products.

## Intellectual Property & IP/Tech Lawyer (December 2015 - April 2022)

Promoted to Senior Associate 3–5 years ahead of peers at boutique firm Sujata
Chaudhri IP Attorneys (SCIP) through strong performance in high-stakes
litigation. Key highlight: helped secure an interim injunction in the landmark
2016 Rubik's Cube trade dress case (Seven Towns v. Kiddiland), which reinforced
protections for toy IP in India. Also drove firm initiatives: migrated the full
website to WordPress, built a sustainable attorney blogging system for thought
leadership, and crafted novel arguments blending neuroscience with trademark
law.

At Rahul Chaudhary & Partners (2019–2022): Handled hundreds of trademark
disputes, resolving most via pre-litigation mediations and favorable
settlements—saving clients substantial time and costs. Drafted robust
agreements, leveraged precedents, managed clients in high-pressure scenarios,
and litigated when needed. Honed negotiation, strategy, and risk assessment
skills directly applicable to startups.

These roles deepened expertise in tech/AI/ML IP dynamics and business strategy,
while building strengths in analytical rigor, innovation, and leadership.
Backed by research: a 2020 study found natural language aptitude (key in legal
training) strongly predicts success in learning programming languages like
Python (see 2020 Nature study:
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60661-8)

## Marketing Associate, Rainmaker (April 2015 - November 2015)

Drove higher email open rates and engagement via personalized, A/B-tested
Mailchimp campaigns (sharp subject lines, tight segmentation, custom HTML
designs). Curated genuine customer testimonials that built trust and increased
site conversions. Ran a high-energy on-campus quiz for 300+ law students,
boosting brand visibility and capturing leads through solid event planning,
team coordination, and live crowd handling.

Got front-row exposure to the full startup lifecycle, including its brutal end:
the company shut down within six months. Saw leadership manage cash burn,
delayed salaries, layoffs, and tough calls up close. The experience forged
resilience to uncertainty, highlighted coding’s potential for massive
efficiency leverage (kickstarting my self-taught programming path and eventual
career shift), and cemented a builder mindset that thrives in high-risk, lean
environments.

## Academic Background

- 2007: Goethe-Zertifikat B1, Goethe-Institut e.V. 
- 2015: B.A. LL.B. (Hons.), Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia National Law University, 
        Lucknow 

## Open Source

I build power-user tools that solve real pain points in programming, data
analysis, and productivity. Highlights include:

a. rt: A terminal-based learning environment (inspired by gtypist and Unix man
pages) built to sharpen programming intuition and build defenses against low-
quality AI-generated code. Supports structured personal notes, deliberate
touch-typing practice, and targeted exercises in Assembly, Python, C, and SQL.
Spiritual successor to my earlier Rust data-science experiments. See:
[rt](https://github.com/ryangerardwilson/rt).

b. o: A custom terminal “OS” for lightning-fast, distraction-free workflows,
echoing the classic Emacs experience. Handles snappy filesystem navigation, Vim
editing, Zathura PDF viewing, and fluid file operations. My go-to IDE for big,
multi-directory projects. See: [o](https://github.com/ryangerardwilson/o).

c. vixl: A recent project in its nascent stages that aims to pack ~80% of
spreadsheet power into the terminal with Vim-like modes (normal, insert,
visual) for navigating and editing live Pandas DataFrames. Lightweight,
keyboard-driven alternative to Excel for fast data exploration and
manipulation. See: [vixl](https://github.com/ryangerardwilson/vixl).

d. rgwml: Warmed up to low-level data-science ops by re-implementing core
Python/Pandas patterns in Rust early in my learning. Result: a high-performance
Rust crate for ML/AI tasks with Python bindings, now widely used in the
community. See: [RGWML](https://crates.io/search?q=rgwml).
